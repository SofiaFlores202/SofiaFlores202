👋 Hi, I’m @SofiaFlores202, a highly motivated Computer Systems Engineer with extensive experience in operating system administration, backend development, data science, database management, and technical documentation.
💃 When I'm not immersed in the tech world, you can find me soaring through the air as an accomplished aerialist instructor or indulging my passion for pastry arts during leisure time.
👀 I’m interested in exploring new opportunities in both the technology and artistic realms and collaborating on exciting projects that blend creativity and technical excellence.
🌱 I’m currently learning new programming languages and staying updated with the latest trends in the tech industry while continuing to refine my skills in aerial dance and baking.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that leverage my technical expertise, creativity, and my love for artistic expression.
